  <p><em>Visualizing the precious moments spent with your children</em></p>
</div>

A tool that visualizes the time parents spend with their children throughout their parenting journey. The algorithm takes into account various real-world factors to provide a realistic estimation of daily hours spent with children, showing both weekday and weekend patterns on a yearly basis.

## Features

- **Yearly Timeline**: Shows time spent with children from one year before first child's birth through 20 years after last child's birth
- **Weekday/Weekend Split**: Separate calculations for weekday and weekend hours to reflect different schedules
- **Multiple Children**: Accounts for overlapping time and shared activities with multiple children
- **Work Pattern Support**: Accommodates various work arrangements from stay-at-home to flexible schedules
- **Shareable Results**: Results can be shared via URL, preserving all input data

## Branding

The Family Time Guide uses a simple, clean design featuring a book with an information icon, symbolizing both the educational journey of parenting and the guidance this tool provides. The mint green color scheme (#4FD1C5) represents growth, harmony, and the fresh perspective this tool brings to understanding family time.

## How It Works

### Time Calculation Factors

The algorithm considers several key factors that influence the time spent with children:

#### Parent Variables
- **Work Hours**: Varies by parent type
  - Stay at Home: 0 hours
  - Full Time Work: 9 hours (including 1 hour lunch)
  - Part Time Work: 5 hours
  - Remote Full Time: 8 hours
  - Remote Part Time: 4 hours
  - Flexible: 6 hours
- **Commute Time**: Varies by work type
  - Stay at Home: 0 hours
  - Full Time Work: 1.5 hours
  - Part Time Work: 1.5 hours
  - Remote Work: 0 hours
  - Flexible: 0.5 hours
- **Parent Sleep Hours**: Adjusts based on youngest child's age
  - Newborn (0): 6 hours
  - Age 1: 6.5 hours
  - Age 2: 7 hours
  - Age 3: 7.5 hours
  - Age 4+: 8 hours
- **Essential Activities**: 1.5 hours daily for basic needs

#### Child Variables
- **Age-Based Sleep Needs**:
  - Newborn (0): 16 hours
  - Age 1: 14 hours
  - Ages 2-4: 12 hours
  - Ages 5-6: 11 hours
  - Ages 7-12: 10 hours
  - Ages 13-17: 9 hours
  - Age 18+: 8 hours

#### Developmental Stages
- **Infancy** (0-1 years)
- **Toddler** (1-4 years)
- **Early Childhood** (4-7 years)
- **Middle Childhood** (7-12 years)
- **Adolescence** (12-17 years)
- **Adulthood** (17+ years)

#### Schooling Stages
- **PreSchool** (â‰¤3 years)
- **Kindergarten** (4-5 years)
- **Elementary** (6-11 years)
- **Middle School** (12-14 years)
- **High School** (15-17 years)
- **Post High School** (18+ years)

### Time Categories

The algorithm calculates active interaction time based on several factors:

#### Base Active Hours by Age Group
- **Infancy**: 12 hours
- **Toddler**: 11 hours
- **Early Childhood**: 8 hours
- **Middle Childhood**: 6 hours
- **Adolescence**: 4 hours
- **Adulthood**: 2 hours

#### Parental Leave Period
- Based on child's wake hours and parent's available time
- Gradual ramp-up during first month
- Smooth transition back to regular schedule in final months

#### Daycare Adjustments
When daycare is used:
- **Stay-at-home Parents**:
  - Infancy: 7 hours
  - Toddler: 6 hours
  - Early Childhood: 5 hours
  - Middle Childhood: 4 hours
  - Adolescence: 3 hours
  - Adulthood: 2 hours
- **Working Parents**:
  - Infancy: 5 hours (morning + evening routines)
  - Toddler: 4.5 hours
  - Other ages: 4 hours

### Multiple Children Adjustments

For each additional child:
- Young children (infants/toddlers): 20% reduction in individual time
- Older children: 30% reduction in individual time
- Minimum multiplier: 0.4 (ensures minimum attention)

### Age Transitions

The algorithm includes smooth transitions:
- Between parental leave and regular schedule
- Between age groups (e.g., infancy to toddler)
- Adjusts for first month after birth

The visualization shows how these factors combine to create a realistic picture of parenting time throughout the years, accounting for both regular patterns and major transitions in children's lives.
